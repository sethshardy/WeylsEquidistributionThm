WeylsEquidistributionThm
Examining goemetric representations of Weyl's equidistribution theorem and experimenting with different "irrational" (long float numbers) values. It was clear that there was a difference when exmaining irrationals with a fractional part closer to a rational with a small denominator vs numbers that were not easily approximated by small denominator fractions.
